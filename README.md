# 💰 Predicting Insurance Charges with Machine Learning for Risk Assessment
**Business Goal:** Can we use patient data to predict insurance costs with high accuracy and automate risk assessments?
---

## The "Why" Behind This Project Insurance carriers face a significant difficulty. **Information asymmetry** When lifestyle risks are not correctly represented in premiums, the company becomes financially unstable. 

Using my skills in **Applied Statistics**, I created this predictive engine to transform raw data into a precise financial forecasting tool that enables businesses to precisely price their risk.
---

## A Data-Driven Solution
I created a prediction model using **Random Forest Regression** to uncover hidden patterns between data features and final insurance charges.

### Technology Stack:**Language:** Python. 🐍
**Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn
**Key Features:** Age, BMI, Smoking Status, and Region
**Methodology:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Encoding, Model Training, and Performance Evaluation.

## Key Performance Results
The model is not only a script, but a high-performing business asset:**R² Score: 0.85** (This model accounts for 85% of the variation in insurance charges).
* **Automation:** Using 'openpyxl', I created a **Excel Export feature** that allows managers to view and evaluate results instantaneously in spreadsheet format.



### The "Talkative" Insight: -> **The Risk Multiplier:** My research shows that certain lifestyle characteristics increase expected expenses by more than **$20,000** on average. This reveals a large opportunity for insurance firms to provide tailored "Wellness Incentives" to reduce long-term claim liabilities.

## 🚀 Strategic business recommendations.
Based on the findings, I urge that insurance stakeholders adopt the following actions:
1. **Incentives for Wellness:** Implement initiatives to encourage lower-risk behaviors, lowering total claim expenses.
2. **Precision Pricing:** Using predictive reasoning, transition from "Flat-Rate" to "Risk-Adjusted" pricing.
3. **Automated Quoting:** Integrate this approach with a digital site to provide fast, data-backed consumer quotes.
