# 💰 Using Machine Learning to Predict Insurance Charges for Risk Assessment

## The Business Objective
Can patient demographic and lifestyle information be utilized to reliably forecast insurance costs and support automated risk-based pricing?

Insurance firms confront **information asymmetry** when lifestyle hazards are not accurately represented in rates.  
This study shows how machine learning can convert raw consumer data into a **trustworthy financial forecasting and risk assessment tool**.

## Model Performance: Actual vs. Predicted Insurance Charges
The scatter plot below demonstrates strong alignment between real and anticipated values, demonstrating robust model performance.[Actual versus Predicted](actual_vs_predicted.png).

### Key Metrics:- R² Score: 0.85.  
- **MAE:** Lower average absolute error  
- **RMSE:** Controlled deviation, even among higher-cost people

## 🔚 Conclusion
This experiment indicates that medical insurance costs may be predicted with great accuracy using demographic and lifestyle information.

The Random Forest model accurately captures complex, non-linear correlations between factors like age, BMI, and smoking status.  
The model's **R² score of 0.85** explains the majority of the variability in insurance expenses, making it acceptable for real-world risk assessment and pricing applications.

The analysis confirms:- **Smoking is the primary expense driver**
- Age and BMI have a substantial influence on expenditures.
- Regional effects are apparent, but secondary.

Overall, this solution demonstrates how machine learning can support **data-driven premium pricing, cost optimization, and risk segmentation** in the insurance industry.
