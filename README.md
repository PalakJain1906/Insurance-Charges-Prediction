# Machine Learning Predicts Insurance Charges for Risk Assessment

## Business Objective 

###  ❓ Can patient demographics and lifestyle information accurately predict insurance prices and support automated, risk-based pricing?

Insurance businesses experience **information asymmetry** when lifestyle-related risks are not adequately reflected in premium calculations.  
This study shows how machine learning can convert raw consumer data into a **trustworthy financial forecasting and risk assessment tool**.

## Project Overview.
Using my skills in **Applied Statistics**, I created a comprehensive predictive analytics pipeline to estimate individual medical insurance costs and identify significant cost drivers.

The solution is intended to be:-     
**Very accurate**
- **Explainable**.
- **Business-Ready**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Distribution of Medical Expenses
The distribution of insurance expenses is **right-skewed**, showing a tiny fraction of persons are responsible for much greater medical costs.[Expense Distribution](expenses_distribution.png).

### The Impact of Smoking on Medical Costs
Smokers have much higher medical expenses compared to non-smokers, making smoking status a key risk factor.[Smoking and Expenses](smoker_vs_expenses.png)

## Model Performance: Actual vs. Predicted Insurance Charges
The scatter plot below exhibits strong agreement between actual and anticipated values, demonstrating the model's powerful predictive capacity.[Actual versus Predicted](actual_vs_predicted.png).

## Key Evaluation Metrics- R² Score: 0.85.  
- **MAE:** Lower average absolute error  
- **RMSE:** Controlled deviation, even among high-cost individuals

## 🔚 Conclusion
This experiment shows that medical insurance prices may be predicted with high accuracy using demographic and lifestyle data.

The Random Forest model excels at capturing complicated, non-linear interactions between variables such as age, BMI, and smoking status.  
The model's **R² score of 0.85** explains most of the variability in insurance expenses, making it appropriate for real-world risk assessment and premium pricing applications.

Key findings from the analysis: **Smoking is the biggest expense driver**.- Age and BMI have a significant impact on insurance premiums.
- Regional concerns have an impact on expenses but serve only as a secondary purpose.

Overall, this solution shows how machine learning can help with **data-driven pricing strategies, cost optimization, and risk segmentation** in the insurance industry.
